# Final-project
Create a weather forcasting model for LEO satellite.

The project forms Genesis - global earth, low latency, extreme broadband satellite access; 


The purpose of the project is to develop a model for predicting weather and improving communication broadband characteristics for satellite LEO, by deep learning. 


### General milestones:
- Development of an initial algorithm for the effect of weather in a particular area.
- Expanding the algorithm into two central continents.
